This app is for mobile users to download their  contents from Internet considering mobile users'  monetary cost and battery used.  The core algorithm is a reinforcement learning  based algorithm, which is proposed by Cheng  ZHANG (cheng.zhang@akane.waseda.jp) at  Waseda University, Japan.   

The following paper describes the details of basic idea of the proposed algorithm.
